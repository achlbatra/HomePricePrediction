# Home Price Prediction Project  

## Overview  
The **Home Price Prediction** project is a web-based application that predicts house prices based on user inputs such as location, size, number of bedrooms, and other features. It utilizes a machine learning model built with **Scikit-learn** and is powered by a **Flask** backend, along with an **HTML/CSS/JavaScript** frontend for user interaction.  

The dataset for this project was sourced from **Kaggle** and contains various features related to housing, including location, square footage, number of rooms, and more.  

## Features  
- **Accurate Price Prediction**: Estimates house prices based on user inputs.  
- **Web Application**: User-friendly interface for entering details and receiving predictions.  
- **Data Preprocessing**: Cleaned and prepared dataset for training.  
- **Machine Learning**: Built and evaluated a predictive model for price estimation.  

## Tech Stack  
- **Frontend**: HTML, CSS, JavaScript  
- **Backend**: Flask  
- **Machine Learning**: Scikit-learn  
- **Programming Language**: Python  

## Dataset  
- **Source**: Kaggle  
- **Description**: The dataset includes features such as location, size, number of bedrooms, bathrooms, and other relevant housing characteristics.  

## Steps Involved  
1. **Data Collection**:  
   - Downloaded the dataset from Kaggle.  
2. **Data Cleaning and Preprocessing**:  
   - Handled missing values, outliers, and categorical variables.  
3. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**:  
   - Visualized patterns and relationships in the data.  
4. **Feature Engineering**:  
   - Enhanced dataset with new features to improve model performance.  
5. **Model Training**:  
   - Trained a machine learning model using Scikit-learn.  
   - Evaluated the model using metrics such as RMSE and RÂ².  
6. **Web Application Development**:  
   - Integrated the model with a Flask backend.  
   - Designed a user-friendly interface using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.  

## Installation  
1. Clone the repository:  
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/home-price-prediction.git
   cd home-price-prediction
   ```  
2. Install dependencies:  
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```  
3. Run the Flask application:  
   ```bash
   python app.py
   ```  
4. Open your browser and navigate to:  
   ```
   http://127.0.0.1:5000
   ```  

## Results  
- The model provides reasonably accurate price predictions based on user inputs.  
- Key insights from the dataset:  
  - [Insight 1: e.g., Locations significantly affect prices.]  
  - [Insight 2: Larger homes tend to have a higher price range.]  

## Future Scope  
- Add more features to the dataset, such as crime rates or proximity to amenities.  
- Improve the model by testing advanced algorithms.  
- Deploy the application to a cloud platform for broader accessibility.
